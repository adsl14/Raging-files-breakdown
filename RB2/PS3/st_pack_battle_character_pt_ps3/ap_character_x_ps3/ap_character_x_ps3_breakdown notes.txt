chara_000_voicetbl.dat: controls which voice line is said during action (signature, activation of skills)

chara_000_skillseseqtbl.dat: holds the amount of sounds effects used in a signature skill (goku doesnt have any since he uses a generic punch, cell has 4 since he has four steps in his signature)

se_sequence folders: holds data on which sound effect is used during that specific action (example: goku charges so charge sound effect, seseq file points to a specific sound effect probably in one of the paks so the correct sound can play during animation)

.lps: character lips file, exactly budokai tenkaichi 3. research has been done and can be incorporated here.
