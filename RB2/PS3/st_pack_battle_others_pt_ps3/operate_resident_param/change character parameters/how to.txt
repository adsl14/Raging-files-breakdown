- Goku starts in pos 66723 and the next position of the next character, is each 33 positions. It has the following values:

01 -> Goku ssj
02 -> Goku ssj2
03 -> Goku ssj3
64 -> Nothing

If you want the character position, do the following: 66723 + (character number * 33)
To get the value of the character you want to transform, just take the number from the afl (or afs) of the character and convert the number to hex.

The red rectangle below to what transformation you want to transform to

For the type of transformation or returning to base, after the transformations slot and a block of four bytes, there will be four bytes (each for transformation)

00 -> transformation anim
01 -> return to base anim
