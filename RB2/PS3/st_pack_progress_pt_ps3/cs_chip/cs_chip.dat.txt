0x00 to 0x63 characters
0x65 empty slot
0xFE special character
0xFD random character

This file has the ID of the character for the main roster. If you write a ID here, the game will search in cs_form that ID (ID character or transformation slot). If the ID doesn't exists, neither in character ID block or transformation slot, the game crash.

If you want to convert a transformation to a separated character, you need to change all the ID's in the transformation slot of that character or else, the separated character will have the transformations of the base character.
