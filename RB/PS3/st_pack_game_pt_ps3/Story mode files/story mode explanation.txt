0A or 1A is a pointer to instructions followed by the value: 0A 04 

to find true value, go to gsdt section copy from under the header to next to last EOFC. paste it into a blank hex file.
get your value ( for example 04) multiply times 4 = 16
16 is the location of the specific byte
go to your new hex file you pasted gsdt into, press CONTROL+G and paste 16 (make sure its decimal)
the value your brought to is the true value the instructions are pointing to
now let's say you wanna switch the values, we'll go to spot you want. take note of location.
divide that by 4, and convert to hex and move to original gsc file
now put that new value over the old value (4) 
done!
